## Introduction
As it is common knowledge, people from the West side of Attika are supirior in every way compared to the rest of the Attika's Valley. What most people don't take into account is that within the western region people are divided into numerous local groups, depending on the city they living, eg. Korydalliotes, Peiraiotes, Nikaiotes.

## Why Korydalliotes are supirior
It is evident to whomever has lived among them that while all the groups mentioned above share a lot of common characteristics, like their religious adoration to "Thrylos" and their need to drive loud cars, Korydalliotes show some sign of supiour behaviour.
This specific group are what you'd call "Magkes", this is a state of mind only they can understand, somebody living outside the town wouldn't even begin to comprehend even if they explained it to them.
